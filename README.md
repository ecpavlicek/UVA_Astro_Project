This was my summer 2025 astrophysics project, working under Dr. Yifan Zhou at the University of Virginia. 
The project is titled "The Spectral and Orbital Characterization of Brown Dwarf - White Dwarf Binaries" and is mostly centered around the systems SDSS J1411 and WD1202. 
I am still finalizing this project and turning it into a AAS research note as of December 2025.
